                    <h3>Final Summary for Level 1</h3>
                    <p>The Restated Net Investment Income Maintenance Agreement for Securian Funds Trust, effective May 1, 2012, involves Advantus Capital Management, Inc. as the Investment Adviser and Securian Financial Services, Inc. as the Underwriter. The agreement concerns the Advantus Money Market Fund within the Trust. This agreement is a reorganization of prior agreements dating back to February 1, 2009. The parties involved in this agreement desire to adopt and set forth these new terms. The document discusses an agreement related to the compensation of an investment adviser for a fund based on its average daily net assets. It also mentions that underwriters have entered into an underwriting agreement and that the investment adviser will waive their advisory fee if the fund's net investment income is zero. The terms 'fund investment income' and 'fund operating expenses' are defined, with the former including interest dividends, net foreign withholding taxes, and income from securities lending activities, while the latter encompasses various fees and expenses incurred by the fund. The text discusses the calculation of Fund Operating Expenses and how they are affected by investment advisory fees. These expenses include various costs such as interest, taxes, and brokerage commissions. The text also mentions a method for computing an Expense Waiver, which involves reducing the advisory fee when necessary to bring the Net Investment Income to zero. Additionally, it explains that the Investment Adviser has the right to recover the waived amount if the Fund's Net Investment Income exceeds zero, unless they have expressly exercised their right to waive a portion of the Expense Waiver. This text discusses the recovery of an 'Expense Waiver' and its connection to investment income. The Expense Waiver can be elected by the Investment Adviser, and if it's recovered, it could cause the Fund's Net Investment Income to fall to zero. Payments will be deferred and may be reimbursed to the Fund or the Investment Adviser based on specific conditions set forth in the text. Furthermore, the text mentions an Underwriter that can waive Rule 12b-1 fees, and a continuing effect period of one year after the execution of the agreement. Finally, it discusses the termination of the agreement under certain circumstances and the recovery of the Expense Waiver within three years. This text outlines the terms of an expense waiver agreement between an Investment Adviser and a Fund. Key points include payment reimbursement within 30 days, additional charges such as interest included in reimbursements, and an operating expense limit where the Fund's annual operations must not exceed 1.25% of its average daily net assets. The document also covers underwriter involvement, term termination agreements, miscellaneous provisions including captions and definitions, and a statement on interpretation that nothing within shall require any party to take action contrary to applicable laws or regulations.
